Assignment 1

1. Write a Java program to find the index of an array element.
2. You will be given an array and you need to find the third largest 

(DONE---)3. You are given array consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.

A subarray is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array. Subarray is called increasing if each element of this subarray strictly greater than previous.

o/p -3

4. Rearrange Everything
Given an array of size n where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1, change contents of arr[] so that arr[i] = j is changed to arr[j] = i.
i/p - 22   13 9 41
o/p  - 22  9  13  41

(DONE---) 4. How are duplicate nodes removed in an unsorted linked list?


(DONE---) 5. How do you find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass?

(DONE---) 6. Java Program To Merge A Linked List Into Another Linked List At Alternate Positions.

(DONE---) 7. How do you check if a given linked list contains a cycle? 
How do you find the starting node of the cycle?

8. Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

(DONE---) 9. How to check if a given linked list is a palindrome?

10. You are given N numbers and a integer K. Your task is to reverse all the numbers before and after K.

11.a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted in ascending order.

Eg.
i/p
 20, 5, 10, 30, 25

o/p
 5,10, 20, 25, 30
				   		       th 
12. Consider a singly linked list. Rotate the list from k   position from the last node.
Eg.
  k = 2
10, 20, 30, 40, 50

After rotation
o/p
40, 50, 10, 20, 30

13. Create a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted 
as per given order - 20 40, 5, 3, 60, 50
for insertion call various functions of insertion then delet elements from list by calling 
delAtBeg(), atPos(3), delAtLast() also display list after every deletion and after all insertion
i/p - 20 40, 5, 3, 60, 50
o/p -20 40, 5, 3, 60, 50
after del-
o/p- 40, 3, 60

(DONE---) 14. Write a program to reverse nodes of SLL
15. Create a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted in ascending order.

Eg.
i/p
 20, 5, 10, 30, 25

o/p
 5,10, 20, 25, 30

A basic queue has the following operations:

(DONE---) Enqueue: add a new element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.

Your first task is to implement a queue. 
Then process  queries, where each query can be of three following types:


1 x:  Enqueue element  into the end of the queue.
2  :  Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3  :  Print the element at the front of the queue.
